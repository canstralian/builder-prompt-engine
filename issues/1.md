### Refactor hover/transition animations in `Header`

**Task**: Refactor hover/transition animations in `Header` to use property-specific transitions.

**Details**: Replace the `transition-all` utility for hover effects with targeted properties like `transition-transform` or `transition-opacity`. This reduces performance overhead and aligns hover feedback more tightly with user intent.
